# Week 4: AWS Cloud Foundations - Data Pipeline & Application Deployment

## âœ… Week Overview
This week focuses on:
- Performing ETL processes using AWS Glue
- Creating and managing Data Catalogs
- Summarizing and transforming data
- Deploying Python applications using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Managing S3 logs for deployed applications

---

## 1. âœ… **ETL Architecture Visualization**

A comprehensive architecture diagram outlines the ETL workflow, data flow from ingestion to summarization, and S3 object storage. Each user group interacts with the system through clearly defined roles and pipelines.

---

## 2. âœ… **Glue Data Catalog Configuration**

Three tables were successfully added to the Glue Data Catalog:
- `aca_prg_trf_sys1`, `aca_prg_trf_sys2`, and `aca_prg_trf_sys3`  
All tables were saved in **Parquet** format and are available for querying and job linking.

---

## 3. âœ… **Glue Job: Panel-list-Summarization**

A visual ETL flow was built using AWS Glue Studio, involving:
- Extracting the panel dataset
- Schema changes
- Summarization
- Conversion to Parquet
- Final storage into S3 buckets

---

## 4. âœ… **S3 Folder: Summarized Output Storage**

Data generated from summarization was successfully saved to:
```
s3://academics-cur-lok/panel-list/metrics/system/Report_Date=2025-50-09-09:50/
```

---

## 5. âœ… **Additional Metrics Transformation**

Transformation jobs were run on datasets:
- `faculty-performance`
- `user`
- `preliminary-feedback`

All transformations produced **Parquet** outputs under respective S3 metric folders.

---

## 6. âœ… **Glue Catalog Table Update**

Four new tables were added to reflect updated metrics:
- `faculty performance metrics`
- `feedback metrics`
- `panel-list-metrics`

---

## 7. âœ… **ETL Jobs in Glue Studio**

Three summarization jobs created and successfully run:
- `Panel-list-Summarization`
- `Faculty-Performance-Summarization`
- `Preliminary-Feedback-Summarization`

---

## 8. âœ… **Final Catalog Overview**

The final Glue Data Catalog includes 6 organized tables, allowing seamless querying and future transformation tasks.

---

## 9. âœ… **Deployed Python App on Elastic Beanstalk**

A sample Python application was successfully deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- âœ… URL loaded with **Congratulations Page**
- âœ… Python environment launched successfully

---

## 10. âœ… **Log Handling for Application**

The logs from the Elastic Beanstalk Python environment were tailed and uploaded to:
```
s3://academics-raw-lok/academics/academic-app-log/year-2025/quarter-01/month-02/day-05/TailLogs-1739154681200.txt
```

---

## âœ… Knowledge Check

**Module 2 AWS Academy Cloud Foundations Quiz**  
- Scored: **90%**
- Required: 70%  
âœ… Module successfully completed.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

This week covered the full lifecycle of a data pipeline:
- ETL workflow setup
- Data catalog management
- Visual job execution
- Output validation
- Python application deployment on AWS
- Log maintenance on S3

**Next Steps:**  
Work on analytics and monitoring through Athena or Redshift, and automate Glue workflows.
