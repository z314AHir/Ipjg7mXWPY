  toolbar or on the webpage. It allows you to save:
  - the current tab,
  - the selected content,
  - the selected frame.
- You can also process multiple tabs in one click and save:
  - the selected tabs,
  - the unpinned tabs,
  - all the tabs.
- Select "Annotate and save the page..." in the context menu to:
  - highlight text,
  - add notes,
  - remove content.
- The context menu also allows you to activate the auto-save of:
  - the current tab,
  - the unpinned tabs,
  - all the tabs.
- With auto-save active, pages are automatically saved every time after being
  loaded (or before being unloaded if not).
- Right-click on the SingleFile button and select "Manage extension" (Firefox) /
  "Options" (Chrome) to open the options page.

  upload to GitHub" to upload pages to Google Drive or GitHub respectively.

  saved pages by linking the SHA256 of the pages into the blockchain.
- You can use the customizable shortkey Ctrl+Shift+Y to save the current tab or
  the selected tabs. Go to about:addons and select "Manage extension shortcuts"
  in the cogwheel menu to change it in Firefox. Go to
  chrome://extensions/shortcuts to change it in Chrome.
